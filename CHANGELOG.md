### Fix

-   Fix the possible swap status values returned by cnd.

### Added

-   Added lints to enforce `async` keyword and declaration of returned types.

### Changed

-   `Breaking API Change`: Rename `Swap.tryExecuteAction` to `Swap.tryExecuteSirenAction`. This should make it more explicit that we are only making an HTTP request to cnd here which might return a ledger action.

## [0.11.1] - 2020-02-19

### Fixed

-   Do not gitignore the `dist/` folder to ensure it is included in the published package, add a CI test to test it.

### Changed

-   Expose `tryExecuteAction` and `doLedgerAction` of the `Swap` class.

## [0.10.0] - 2020-01-31

-   `Breaking API Change`: No need to initialise a `MakerHttpApi`, it will be done as part of `MakerNegotiator` and the `listen()` method is moved to `MakerNegotiator` too.
-   `MakerNegotiator.listen()` now accepts an optional hostname.

## Added

-   `MakerNegotiator.getUrl()` returns a string to the maker negotiator external API.

## [0.9.1] - 2020-01-21

### Fixed

-   `InMemoryBitcoinWallet.getBalance()` correctly returns a `number` instead of a `string`.
-   Typing issues related to the abi in `EthereumWallet` are fixed.

## [0.9.0] - 2019-12-17

### Changed

-   `Breaking API` of the negotiation protocol: simplified and renamed interfaces. Make getOrder/takeOrder more explicit for the client
-   `Breaking API` of the Bitcoin wallet. Made the provided wallet to an in-memory wallet only and extracted an interface so that developers can implement their own wallet.

## [0.8.0] - 2019-12-11

### Changed

-   `Breaking API`: Use `BigNumber` from bignumber.js instead of ethers to support floats

## [0.7.0] - 2019-11-27

### Changed

-   Make alpha and beta expiries optional in `SwapRequest`.
-   `ExecutionParams.ledgers` is now optional and defaulted to mainnet values. `chain_id` is used for Ethereum meaning that `comit-rs:^0.4.0` is needed.
-   Improve `TakerNegotiator` API.
-   Change `Order` to have all fields in camelCase.
-   Rename `Swap.getEntity()` & `SwapEntity` to `Swap.fetchDetails()` & `SwapDetails` for clarity.
-   Improve `TryParams` terminology, use of seconds.
-   Use nominal amounts (Bitcoin, Ether instead of Satoshi or Wei) in `Order`.

## [0.6.0] - 2019-11-25

### Fixed

-   Return the tx-id instead of the tx-hash for Bitcoin because it is the canonical way of identifying a transaction.

### Added

-   An order negotiation protocol over HTTP.

### Changed

-   Replace Siren types with Expect Swap types to improve interfaces accuracy.

## [0.4.1] - 2019-10-29

### Added

-   Facade class `ComitClient` that wraps communication with cnd to create and get swaps.

### Fixed

-   Function `postSwap` in class `Cnd` actually returns the URL of the swap.

### Removed

-   Method `getSwap` which assumed on class `Cnd` which assumed a certain path structure that should not be publicly exposed.

## [0.3.2] - 2019-10-03

### Changed

-   Return swap identifier when sending a swap request.
