Thank you for your interest in contributing to COMIT! Contributions are welcome in many forms, and we appreciate all of them.

Please follow the [main contribution guidelines outlined in the comit-rs project](https://github.com/comit-network/comit-rs/blob/dev/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Note that if you wish to directly contribute to the code of this repository, please make pull requests against the `dev` branch as this repository uses the [GitFlow branching model](https://datasift.github.io/gitflow/IntroducingGitFlow.html).

Finally, note that the `declarations` folder is generated using `yarn declarations` and tracked in git.
This is to easily flag any change that could break backward compatible and ensure patch upgrades are
backward compatible.
