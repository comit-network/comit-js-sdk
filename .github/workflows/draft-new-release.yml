            Hi @${{ github.event.issue.user.login }}!

            This PR was created in response to this release issue: #${{ github.event.issue.number }}.
            I've updated the changelog and bumped the versions in the manifest files in this commit: ${{ steps.make-commit.outputs.commit }}.

            Merging this PR will create a GitHub release and upload any assets that are created as part of the release build.
      # GitHub Action does not allow recursion so the CI checks are not trigger when the release branch is pushed
